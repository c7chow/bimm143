names(percent) <- pdb.stats$Experimental.Method
percent
```
X-Ray takes about 89.5% of the entries on PDB

Caclulating the percentage of proteins 
```{r}
percent.p <- (pdb.stats$Proteins/sum(pdb.stats$Proteins))*100
names(percent.p) <- pdb.stats$Experimental.Method
percent.p
```
90% of X-ray readings are protein structures
